st.title("Module 8: Translating English Statements into Logic")

st.markdown("""
In Modules 5–7, we learned how predicates, quantifiers, and nested quantifiers are used to express logical statements.

In this module, we learn how to translate statements written in English into logical notation.

st.subheader("Why Translation Matters")

st.markdown("""
Many statements in mathematics, computer science, and databases are written in English.

Translating these statements into logical notation helps us analyze them precisely.
